In this project, I use python to model and solve some typical probability problems. There are four jupyter notebook files in this project that model four problems respectively.

    flippingDice.ipynb simulates a problem of flipping two dice. It is a common problems in a probability course.

    pickingMarbels.ipynb models another classical problem in probability. Here I give the answers to common questions with this type of problems.

    bayesProblem.ipynb contains a conditional probability problem. Here I use Bayes theorem to solve it both theoretically and simulatically.

    Finally, nallynormaDistribution.ipynb is used to solve a problem that relates to normal distribution. Here I have an example about a weight of a shoe that has normal distribution. The model anwers some of the ordinary questions.

By modifying the code a bit, you can use the code in those files to solve your own problems.
